## Requirements

This theme is intended to be used with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (which depends on [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org)).

## What it shows

* The current folder
* A customizable delimiter
* The current branch
* The current branch state (shows `*` if has uncommited changes)

## Installation

Donwload the theme
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igor9silva/zsh-theme/master/igorsilva.zsh-theme > ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/igorsilva.zsh-theme 
```

Then add (or edit) this line as following in you `~/.zshrc` file
```bash
ZSH_THEME="igorsilva"
```

Open a new terminal window/tab and enjoy being minimal üòô

You can optionally customize the delimiter, just edit `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/igorsilva.zsh-theme` and override `LCHAR`. Even emojis are supported!
